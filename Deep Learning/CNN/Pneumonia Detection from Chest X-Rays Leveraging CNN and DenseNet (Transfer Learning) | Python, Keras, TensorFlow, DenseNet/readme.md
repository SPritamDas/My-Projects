## Project Overview
Pneumonia is a severe infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, and its early detection is crucial for effective treatment. In this project, we aim to develop an automated system for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Transfer Learning**. By leveraging a pre-trained model, we enhance the ability of the AI system to distinguish between **Pneumonia** and **Normal** cases in pediatric patients.

The project utilizes the **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** dataset, which contains over 5,800 X-ray images categorized into two groups: **Pneumonia** and **Normal**. We employ advanced deep learning techniques to create a robust classification model, which can significantly aid in the early diagnosis of pneumonia, especially in regions where access to medical expertise is limited.

### Dataset
The dataset contains chest X-ray images from pediatric patients aged 1 to 5 years and is divided into three sets: **Training**, **Validation**, and **Test**. The images are categorized into:
- **Pneumonia**: X-ray images of patients diagnosed with pneumonia.
- **Normal**: X-ray images of healthy patients.

You can access the dataset on Kaggle:
- **Kaggle Dataset**: [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

## Methodology
We use a CNN-based architecture with transfer learning to extract high-level features from the chest X-rays and classify the images. Transfer learning helps in improving the accuracy by leveraging pre-trained models such as **VGG16** or **ResNet50**, which are fine-tuned for this specific medical classification task.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a reliable AI model that can:
- **Classify chest X-rays** into pneumonia and normal categories.
- **Enhance diagnostic accuracy**, potentially reducing the burden on radiologists.
- Provide a **scalable solution** for pneumonia diagnosis in regions with limited healthcare facilities.

## Technology Stack
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Pre-Trained Models**: VGG16, ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC
